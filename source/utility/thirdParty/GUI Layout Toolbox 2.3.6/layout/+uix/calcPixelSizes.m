function pSizes = calcPixelSizes( pTotal, mSizes, pMinima, pPadding, pSpacing )
%calcPixelSizes  Calculate child sizes in pixels
%
%  pSizes = uix.calcPixelSizes(total,mSizes,minSizes,padding,spacing)
%  computes child sizes (in pixels) given total available size (in pixels),
%  child sizes (in pixels and/or relative), minimum child sizes (in
%  pixels), padding (in pixels) and spacing (in pixels).
%
%  Notes:
%  * All children are at least as large as the minimum specified size
%  * Relative sizes are respected for children larger than then minimum
%  specified size
%  * Children may extend beyond the total available size if the minimum
%  sizes, padding and spacing are too large
