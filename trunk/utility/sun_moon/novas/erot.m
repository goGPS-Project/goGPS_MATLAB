function theta = erot (date1, date2)

% this function returns the value of the earth rotation angle
% (theta) for a given ut1 julian date. the expression used is
% taken from the note to iau resolution b1.8 of 2000.

% input

%  date1 = high-order part of ut1 julian date

%  date2 = low-order part of ut1 julian date

% output

%  theta = earth rotation angle in degrees

% ported from NOVAS 3.0
