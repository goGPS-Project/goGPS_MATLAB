function pos2 = grvd (pos1, pobs, pbody, rmass)

% this function corrects position vector for the deflection
% of light in the gravitational field of an arbitrary body.  adapted
% from murray (1981) mon. notices royal ast. society 195, 639-648.
% see also formulae in section b of the astronomical almanac, or
% kaplan et al. (1989) astronomical journal 97, 1197-1210, section
% iii f.  this function is valid for an observed body within the
% solar system as well as for a star.

%      pos1   = position vector of observed object, with respect to
%               origin at observer (or the geocenter), components
%               in au (in)
%      pobs   = position vector of observer (or the geocenter),
%               with respect to origin at solar system barycenter,
%               components in au (in)
%      pbody  = position vector of gravitating body, with respect to
%               origin at solar system barycenter, components
%               in au (in)
%      rmass  = reciprocal mass of gravitating body in solar mass
%               units, that is, sun mass / body mass (in)
%      pos2   = position vector of observed object, with respect to
%               origin at observer (or the geocenter), corrected for
%               gravitational deflection, components in au (out)
