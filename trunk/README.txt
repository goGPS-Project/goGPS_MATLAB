1. Introduction
   ============
   goGPS is a software package designed to perform GPS navigation
   with low cost receivers, either in post-processing or real-time.
   It is developed in MATLAB and it is aimed at providing a tool
   useful for studying GPS navigation, implementing and testing new
   algorithms and interacting in general with GPS-related aspects.

2. Requirements
   ============
   goGPS has been developed and tested in MATLAB 7.* environments,
   running on Windows machines. The following elements are needed
   in order to use goGPS:
   
   - a computer with Windows operating system
   - a MATLAB 7.* installation
   -
