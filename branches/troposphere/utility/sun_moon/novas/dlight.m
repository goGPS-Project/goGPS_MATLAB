function diflt = dlight (pos1, pe)

% this function returns the difference in light-time, for a star,
% between the barycenter of the solar system and the observer (or
% the geocenter).

% input

%  pos1  = position vector of star, with respect to origin at
%          solar system barycenter

%  pe    = position vector of observer (or the geocenter),
%          with respect to origin at solar system barycenter,
%          components in au

% output

%  diflt = difference in light time, in the sense star to
%          barycenter minus star to earth, in days

% -or-

% this function returns the light-time from the observer (or the
% geocenter) to a point on a light ray that is closest to a
% specific solar system body.

% input

%  pos1 = position vector toward observed object, with respect
%         to origin at observer (or the geocenter)

%  pe   = position vector of solar system body, with respect
%         to origin at observer (or the geocenter), components in au

% output

%  diflt = light time to point on line defined by pos1 that is
%          closest to solar system body (positive if light
%          passes body before hitting observer, i.e., if
%          pos1 is within 90 degrees of pe)
