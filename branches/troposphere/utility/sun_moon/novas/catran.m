% note 1:  date1 and date2 may be specified either as a julian
% date (e.g., 2433282.5d0) or a julian year and fraction
% (e.g., 1950.0d0).  values less than 10000 are assumed to
% be years.  for it=2 or it=3, either date1 or date2 must be
% 2451545.0 or 2000.0 (j2000.0).  for it=4 and it=5, date1 and
% date2 are ignored.

% note 2:  it=1 updates the star's data to account for
% the star's space motion between the first and second dates,
% within a fixed reference system.  it=2 applies a rotation
% of the reference system corresponding to precession between
% the first and second dates, but leaves the star fixed in space.
% it=3 provides both transformations.  it=4 and it=5 provide a
% a fixed rotation about very small angles (<0.1 arcsecond) to
% take data from the dynamical system of j2000.0 to the icrs (it=4)
% or vice versa (it=5).

% note 3:  for it=1, input data can be in any fixed reference
% system. for it=2 or it=3, this subroutine assumes the input data
% is in the dynamical system and produces output in the dynamical
% system.  for it=4, the input data must be on the dynamical equator
% and equinox of j2000.0.  for it=5, the input data must be in the
% icrs.

% note 4:  this subroutine cannot be properly used to bring data
% from old star catalogs into the modern system, because
% old catalogs were compiled using a set of constants that are
% incompatible with modern values.  in particular, it should not
% be used for catalogs whose positions and proper motions were
% derived by assuming a precession constant significantly different
% from the value implicit in subroutine preces.
