function pos2 = spin (angl, pos1)

% this function transforms a vector from one coordinate system
% to another with same origin and axes rotated about the z axis.

% input

%  angl = angle of coordinate system rotation, positive
%         counterclockwise when viewed from +z, in degrees

%  pos1 = position vector

% output

%  pos2 = position vector expressed in new coordinate
%         system rotated about z by angle ang

% ported from NOVAS 3.0
