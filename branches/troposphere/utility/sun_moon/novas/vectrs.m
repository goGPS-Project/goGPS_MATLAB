% this function converts angular quantities related to a star's
% position and motion to vectors.

% input

%  ra     = right ascension in hours

%  dec    = declination in degrees

%  pmra   = proper motion in ra in milliarcseconds per year
               
%  pmdec  = proper motion in dec in milliarcseconds per year

%  parllx = parallax in milliarcseconds

%  rv     = radial velocity in kilometers/second

% output

%  pos = position vector, equatorial rectangular coordinates,
%           with respect to solar system barycenter, components in au

%  vel = velocity vector, equatorial rectangular coordinates,
%        with respect to solar system barycenter, components in au/day
