function rv = radvl (pos, vel, velobs, star, dist)

% this function predicts the radial velocity of the observed
% object as it would be measured by spectroscopic means.  radial
% velocity is here defined as the radial velocity measure (z)
% times the speed of light.  for a solar system body, it applies
% to a fictitious emitter at the center of the observed object,
% assumed massless (no gravitational red shift), and does not
% in general apply to reflected light.  for stars, it includes
% all effects, such as gravitational red shift, contained
% in the catalog barycentric radial velocity measure, a scalar
% derived from spectroscopy.  nearby stars with a known kinematic
% velocity vector (obtained independently of spectroscopy) can be
% treated like solar system objects.  see lindegren & dravins
% (2003), astronomy & astrophysics 401, 1185-1201.

%      pos    = geometric position vector of object with respect to
%               observer, corrected for light-time, in au (in)
%      vel    = velocity vector of object with respect to solar
%               system barycenter, components in au/day (in)
%      velobs = velocity vector of observer with respect to solar
%               system barycenter, components in au/day (in)
%      star   = 3-element array of catalog data for a star, to be
%               non-zero if observed object is a star for which the
%               catalog radial velocity is consistent with
%               the iau definition of barycentric radial velocity
%               measure (otherwise all elements should be set to
%               0.d0 exactly) (in)
%               star(1) = catalog ra in hours
%               star(2) = catalog dec in degrees
%               star(3) = z*c, the catalog barycentric radial
%                         velocity measure times the speed of light,
%                         in kilometers/second
%               all three data elements must apply to the same
%               epoch (usually j2000.0 = jd 2451545.0 tt)
%      dist   = 3-element array of distances in au (in)
%               dist(1) = distance of observer from the geocenter
%               dist(2) = distance of observer from the sun
%               dist(3) = distance of object from the sun
%      rv     = the observed radial velocity measure times
%               the speed of light, in kilometers/second (out)

% note 1:  all the input arguments are bcrs quantities, expressed
% with respect to the icrs axes.  vel and velobs are kinematic
% velocities -- derived from geometry or dynamics, not spectroscopy.

% note 2:  if any element of array star is non-zero, the algorithm
% used will be consistent with the iau definition of stellar
% radial velocity, specifically, the barycentric radial velocity
% measure, which is derived from spectroscopy.  in that case,
% the vector vel can be very approximate -- or, for distant stars
% or galaxies, zero -- as it will be used only for a small geometric
% correction that is proportional to proper motion.

% note 3:  any of the distances in array dist can be set to zero
% (0.d0) if the corresponding general relativistic gravitational
% potential term is not to be evaluated.  these terms
% generally are important only at the meter/second level.  if
% the first two distances are both zero, an average value
% will be used for the relativistic term for the observer,
% appropriate for an observer on the surface of the earth.  the
% third distance, if given, is used only for solar system objects.
