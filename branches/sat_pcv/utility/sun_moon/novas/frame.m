function pos2 = frame (pos1, k)

% this function transforms a vector from the dynamical reference
% system to the international celestial reference system (icrs),
% or vice versa.  the dynamical reference system is based on the
% dynamical mean equator and equinox of j2000.0.  the icrs is
% based on the space-fixed icrs axes defined by the radio catalog
% positions of several hundred extragalactic objects.  the rotation
% matrix used here is equivalent to that given by hilton and
% hohenkerk (2004), astronomy and astrophysics 413, 765-770,
% eq. (6) and (8).

% input

%  pos1 = position vector, equatorial rectangular coordinates

%  k    = direction of rotation

%         set k < 0 for dynamical to icrs
%         set k > 0 for icrs to dynamical

% output

%  pos2 = position vector, equatorial rectangular coordinates

% note:  for geocentric coordinates, the same transformation is
% used between the dynamical reference system and the gcrs.
