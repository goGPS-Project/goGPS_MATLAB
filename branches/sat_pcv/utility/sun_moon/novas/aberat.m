function pos2 = aberat (pos1, ve, tlight)

% this function corrects position vector for aberration of light.
% algorithm includes relativistic terms.  adapted from murray (1981)
% mon. notices royal ast. society 195, 639-648.

% input

%  pos1   = position vector of observed object, with reespect to
%           origin at observer (or the geocenter), components in au

%  ve     = velocity vector of observer (or the geocenter),
%           with respect to origin at solar system barycenter,
%           components in au/day (in)

%  tlight = light time from body to observer (or the geocenter) in days

% output

%  pos2 = position vector of observed object, with respect to
%         origin at observer (or the geocenter), corrected
%         for aberration, components in au
