% note 3: if locatn = 1 and observ(4) = 0.0d0, the value of delta-t will

% defined by the user via call to setdt.

% note 4: skypos(7), the radial velocity, is the predicted
% radial velocity measure (z) times the speed of light, an
% inherently spectroscopic measure. for a star, it
% includes all effects, such as gravitational red shift,
% contained in the catalog barycentric radial velocity measure,
% which is assumed given in star(6). for a solar system
% body, it applies to a fictitious emitter at the center of the
% observed object, assumed massless (no gravitational red shift),
% and does not in general apply to reflected light.
