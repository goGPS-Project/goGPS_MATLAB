function [psicor, epscor] = celpol (tjd, itype, dpole1, dpole2)

% this function allows for the specification of celestial pole
% offsets for high-precision applications. each set of offsets is
% a correction to the modeled position of the pole for a specific
% date, derived from observations and published by the iers.
% this entry, if used, should be called before any other routines
% for a given date. values of the pole offsets specified via a call
% to this entry will be used until explicitly changed.

%      tjd    = tdb or tt julian date for pole offsets (in)

%      itype  = type of pole offset (in)

%               set itype = 1 for corrections to angular coordinates
%                             of modeled pole referred to mean
%                             ecliptic of date, that is,
%                             delta-delta-psi and delta-delta-epsilon

%               set itype = 2 for corrections to components of
%                             modeled pole unit vector with referred
%                             to gcrs axes, that is, dx and dy

%      dpole1 = value of celestial pole offset in first coordinate,
%               (delta-delta-psi or dx) in milliarcseconds (in)

%      dpole2 = value of celestial pole offset in second coordinate,
%               (delta-delta-epsilon or dy) in milliarcseconds (in)

% note 1: tjd is used only for itype = 2, to transform dx and dy to
%         the equivalent delta-delta-psi and delta-delta-epsilon values.

% note 2: for itype = 2, dx and dy are unit vector component
%         corrections, but are expressed in milliarcseconds simply by
%         multiplying by 206264806, the number of milliarcseconds in one
%         radian.
