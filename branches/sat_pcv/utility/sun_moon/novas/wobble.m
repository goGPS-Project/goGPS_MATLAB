function pos2 = wobble (tjd, x, y, pos1)

% this function corrects a vector in the itrs (a rotating earth-
% fixed system) for polar motion, and also corrects the longitude
% origin (by a tiny amount) to the terrestrial intermediate origin
% (tio).  the itrs vector is thereby transformed to the terrestrial
% intermediate system, based on the true (rotational) equator and
% the terrestrial intermediate origin (tio).  since the true equator
% is the plane orthogonal to the direction of the celestial
% intermediate pole (cip), the components of the output vector are
% referred to z and x axes toward the cip and tio, respectively.

% input

%  tjd  = tt or ut1 julian date 

%  x    = conventionally-defined x coordinate of celestial
%         intermediate pole with respect to itrs pole, in arcseconds 

%  y    = conventionally-defined y coordinate of celestial
%         intermediate pole with respect to itrs pole, in arcseconds 

%  pos1 = position vector, geocentric equatorial rectangular
%         coordinates, referred to itrs axes 

% output

%  pos2 = position vector, geocentric equatorial rectangular
%         coordinates, referred to true equator and tio
