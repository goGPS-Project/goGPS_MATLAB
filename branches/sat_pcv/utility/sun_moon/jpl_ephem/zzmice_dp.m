%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      x   an input numeric to convert to double precision
%
%   the call:
%
%      y = zzmice_dp(x)
%
%   returns:
%
%      y   the double precision representation of 'x'
%
%-Examples
%
%   None.
%
%-Particulars
%
%   This routine exists to support the NAIF MATLAB-CSPICE interface.
%
%-Required Reading

%
%-Version
%
%   -Mice Version 1.1.0, 27-JUL-2009, EDW (JPL)
%
%      Added value check on 'nargin'. Incorrect input argument type/form
%      error tag changed from "MICE(BADVAL)" to "MICE(BADARG)."
%
%   -Mice Version 1.0.1, 30-DEC-2008, EDW (JPL)
%
%      Function ensures all input values as finite.   
%
%      Corrected misspellings.
