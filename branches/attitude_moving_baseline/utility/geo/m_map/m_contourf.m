%  M_CONTOURF Adds filled contours to a map
%    M_CONTOURF(LONG,LAT,DATA,...) is the same as M_CONTOUR except
%    that contours are filled. Areas of data above a given level are
%    filled, areas below are left blank or are filled by a lower level.
%    NaN's in the data leave holes in the filled plot/
%
%    [CS,H] = M_CONTOURF(...) returns contour matrix C as described in 
%    CONTOURC and a vector H of handles to PATCH objects (for use by
%    CLABEL).

%  9/12/98 - handle all-NaN plots without letting contour crash.
% 6/Nov/00 - eliminate returned stuff if ';' neglected (thx to D Byrne)
% Apr/06  - workaround for v7 bug in contourf.
